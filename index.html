<h1>Hello World! This is where I keep my projects alive.</h1>
<p>Most of my projects are from tutorials given by Brackeys.  I started learning Javascript and Python, but it was really dry
  and was easy to get distracted with so many paths to take.  It was like watching a tv series that never ended.  Then I found game development to be
  like a movie where once I dedicate a few hours and I would have a working prototype.</p>
  <p> So now I am interested in the AR and VR mountain of work, since there is still a long way to go, I want to jump in and see
    how big of a splash I can make.</p>
  
  <p> These are the project scripts you can check out at https://github.com/big616.</p>
  
  <b>Unity Games</b>
  
  <p>Doodle Jump replica : I used a funny picture of my gf as the doodle to give her a surprise.  The theme is 
  her jumping on clouds with a rainbow swirl background. This is my first project with Brackeys. Features learned: Camera follow, random platform generation,
  platform effector and forces.</p>
  
    <p>Fruit Ninja replica : Watermelon spawning and jumping around the screen as player tries to slice with the mouse as a blade.
    Features learned: Trail renderer, spawn points with forces, timed destroy gameobjects, 3d graphics in a 2d game.</p>
  
  <p>Angry Bird replica : A player flies into enemy towers, enemies are destroyed if the force of an impact is greater than their 
  health.  Features learned: Sorting layers, spring joints, mass and velocity, particle systems.</p>
  
 <p>Line Rider replica : Player draws lines for a sprite to ride across on.  Features learned: Line renderer, capsule collider.</p>

<p>Rolling Ball : This is part of the Unity tutorial series and was my first replication.  Features learned: Colliders, player control,
  destroy gameobjects. </p>
  
  <b>Vuforia in Unity</b>
  
<p> AR tutorial from Matthew Hallberg: A car falls from the sky, and onto the a plain.  The doors open as you approach, and a video plays when
  the viewer is inside the car.  This needs a compatiable AR phone to be tested, but should work if built out.  Features
  learned: Ground detection by plane finder, AR camera detection to open doors, audio and video effects. </p>
  
  <b>Blender</b>
  <p> My Blue barrel: Tutorial from Brackeys for 3d modeling.  Features learned: modeling, texturing, rendering and exporting.</p>
